# Simplify compiling CREFL. Compile commands were copied from original files and modified to fit Makefile (see readme).
#
# Example Compile Usage (where static dependencies headers and libaries are in ~/opt/):
#       LDFLAGS="-I ~/opt/include -L ~/opt/lib" make
#
# Example Install Usage (where files will be installed in ~/bin):
#       PREFIX="~" make install
