"""Module to store all constants.  Any constant needed in more than one
component, or potentially more than one part, of polar2grid should be
defined here.

Rules/Preferences:
    - All values lowercase
    - strings
    - user-legible (assume that they may be printed in log messages)
    - use == for comparison (not 'is' or 'not' or other)

Possible confusions:
    The VIIRS fog product created by polar2grid is a temperature difference of
    2 I bands.  It is classified as an I band for this reason, meaning the
    band is "fog", not the usual number.

Exceptions:
    - Return status constants are not strings so that they can be or'ed and
        can be interpreted by a command line shell.
