Functions related to histogram equalization. This is a scaling function like the
others found in rescale.py, but has so much support infrastructure it's been moved
to it's own module.

:attention:
    A scaling function is not guarenteed to not change the
    original data array passed.  If fact, it is faster in most cases
    to change the array in place.
