Polar2Grid
==========

Polar2Grid is a software package providing scripts, utilities, and a series
of functions and classes for reading
polar-orbiting satellite data, remapping or gridding that data, and writing
it to a file format to be used by other software. Polar2grid is mainly used
through one or more :term:`glue scripts <glue script>` that execute a common
sequence of
functions known as ":term:`The Chain`". These functions being called act
as a toolbox for software developers to make their own scripts if the provided
:term:`glue scripts <glue script>` don't fit their needs.

Code repository: https://github.com/davidh-ssec/polar2grid

If you are a developer wishing to add your own frontend or backend please
see the :doc:`Developer's Guide <dev_guide/index>` for details on how to do so.
