POLAR2GRID
==========

Polar2grid is a software package for converting polar-orbitting satellite
data from various sources (VIIRS, MODIS, etc.) into
formats that are useable by meteorlogical visualization applications,
such as AWIPS, NINJO, WMS, etc.

The main code repository is hosted at https://github.com/davidh-ssec/polar2grid

The main documentation site is http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/software/polar2grid/

Branching Model
---------------

The branching model used by the Polar2Grid team follows a basic ``feature-branch`` -> ``develop`` -> ``master``
structure.
New features still in development should get their own branches. Once these features are complete they are merged
into the ``develop`` branch. Once all features for a particular release have been tested and are considered
"release ready" they are merged into the ``master`` branch. If a master merge is for a new minor version a
maintenance branch is also created for future bug fixes. This branching model was inspired from the discussion
`here <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_.

SVN Conversion Notes
--------------------

The original repository included a "vendor" directory in the root repository
that was being used to store the vendor release of ms2gt.  The repository was
converted to git using "svn2git" which does not support this structure.
For now, the "vendor" directory is represented by the ``ms2gt`` directory in
the root of the git repository.
